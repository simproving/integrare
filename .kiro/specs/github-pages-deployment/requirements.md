# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves converting the existing TypeScript project to use Vite as the build tool and configuring it for deployment to GitHub Pages. The current project uses a custom TypeScript build process, but we need to modernize it with Vite for better development experience and easier deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Vite as the build tool, so that I can have faster development builds and hot module replacement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN Vite SHALL compile TypeScript files and bundle assets
2. WHEN running in development mode THEN Vite SHALL provide hot module replacement
3. WHEN building for production THEN Vite SHALL optimize and minify the output
4. IF the build process fails THEN Vite SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to be deployable to GitHub Pages, so that I can host the application publicly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build command runs THEN the system SHALL generate static files in the dist directory
2. WHEN deployed to GitHub Pages THEN the application SHALL load correctly with proper asset paths
3. WHEN accessing the deployed application THEN all routes and resources SHALL work correctly
4. IF the base path is configured THEN all asset references SHALL use the correct base URL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated GitHub Actions deployment, so that the site updates automatically when I push to the main branch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically build the project
2. WHEN the build succeeds THEN GitHub Actions SHALL deploy the built files to GitHub Pages
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the live site SHALL reflect the latest changes
4. IF the build fails THEN the deployment SHALL not proceed and errors SHALL be reported

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain existing functionality, so that the conversion to Vite doesn't break any current features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vite setup is complete THEN all existing TypeScript modules SHALL compile correctly
2. WHEN running tests THEN Vitest SHALL execute all existing test suites successfully
3. WHEN the application runs THEN all current functionality SHALL work as before
4. IF any dependencies are updated THEN compatibility SHALL be maintained
