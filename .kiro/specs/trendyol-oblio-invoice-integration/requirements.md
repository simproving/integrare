# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated invoice integration service that synchronizes invoice data between Trendyol (Turkish e-commerce platform) and Oblio (Romanian accounting software). The service will automatically fetch invoice data from Trendyol's API and create corresponding invoices in Oblio's system, ensuring seamless financial record keeping for businesses operating on both platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner using both Trendyol and Oblio, I want invoices from Trendyol orders to be automatically created in Oblio, so that I can maintain accurate financial records without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a button THEN the system SHALL use Trendyol API to get all orders that do not have an invoice assigned
2. WHEN order data is successfully retrieved from Trendyol THEN the system SHALL transform the data to match Oblio's invoice format
3. WHEN the data transformation is complete THEN the system SHALL create a corresponding invoice in Oblio via their API and keep track of which Trendyol order it belongs to
4. IF the invoice creation in Oblio fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry up to 3 times
5. WHEN an invoice is successfully created in Oblio THEN that invoice SHALL be sent to Trendyol via their API

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure API credentials and sync settings, so that I can control how the integration operates between the two platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set Trendyol API credentials (API key, secret, seller ID)
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set Oblio API credentials (email, secret key)
3. WHEN configuring sync settings THEN the administrator SHALL be able to define sync frequency (manual, hourly, daily)
4. WHEN configuring sync settings THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set date ranges for invoice synchronization
5. IF invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to monitor the synchronization status and handle errors, so that I can ensure all invoices are properly integrated and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sync process runs THEN the system SHALL log all sync attempts with timestamps and results
2. WHEN an invoice sync fails THEN the system SHALL record the failure reason and affected invoice details
3. WHEN viewing sync status THEN the user SHALL see successful, failed, and pending invoice counts
4. WHEN a sync error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for troubleshooting
5. WHEN manual intervention is needed THEN the user SHALL be able to retry failed invoice syncs individually
